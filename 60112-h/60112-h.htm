<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indd"><big><big><b>T</b></big></big>HE following Poem was suggested in an excursion one afternoon to
Attenburrow, a village on the banks of the Trent, about five miles
south-west of Nottingham, the birthplace of the well known Republican,
<span class="smcap">General Ireton</span>.</p>

<p class="indd">If, in the contemplation of the character of that illustrious man, and
in the indulgence of feelings excited by a consideration of the great
struggle in which he bore so distinguished a part, the author has been
led, in the progress of this poem, to animadvert strongly on the state
of society as existing in some countries; or to avow sentiments
peculiarly favourable to forms of popular government, as opposed to
absolute monarchy;&mdash;he assures the reader it is not with any wish or
intention to weaken the bonds which hold society together, or to excite
to discontent or insubordination those classes of the community
dependent on labour for their support. His object has been to shew
mankind, that their vices and follies are the real cause of their
degradation;&mdash;that good morals, springing from right principles, form
the only sure foundation of civil liberty; and that the men who would
found an improvement of the social system, on any other basis than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6a" id="page_6a">[Pg 6]</a></span> that
of an improved moral and intellectual condition of the people, can only
enter on a course of fearfully hazardous experiments: rationally hoping
for nothing but to reap from the crimes of others, a harvest of contempt
and execration as their own portion.</p>

<p class="indd">The true patriot is he who aims to elevate the tone of morals among his
fellow citizens,&mdash;to excite them to a just respect for themselves,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indd">This was the true spirit of the eminent reformers of the age of Charles
the first. They had undertaken the important work of settling the
national character and institutions, at a period when men’s minds
generally were bent on obtaining an improvement of their social
condition&mdash;and an extensive toleration of religious opinions: and to
accomplish the great benefits their sedate and comprehensive minds
contemplated, they strove to induce among all classes, severe and
independent habits of thinking and feeling in reference to politics and
religion: without which they knew it would be in vain to attempt to
abolish the pageantry and frivolity connected with kingly government,
that they had begun to despise; or to supersede the heathenish rites and
vain ceremonies of outward religion, the reliques of popery, which their
souls abhorred; by those spiritual and devout exercises of the mind that
themselves practised, and which they conscientiously believed the good
of society required, and the laws of God enjoined.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#FN_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Among the patriots
no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7a" id="page_7a">[Pg 7]</a></span> was more deeply imbued with this sublime spirit, nor partook
more largely of the generous enthusiasm it excited, than <span class="smcap">Henry Ireton</span>,
whose inflexible virtue, after the apparent defection of Cromwell,
formed the basis on which rested the darling hopes of all the virtuous
and enlightened reformers of his day.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="indd"><a name="FN_A" id="FN_A"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Just as the above remarks were going to press, a friend put
into the author’s hands, William Godwin’s History of the Commonwealth&mdash;a
work which he has just cause to regret he had not the good fortune to
become acquainted with earlier: as many useful hints and much
interesting matter might have been afforded him both for his preface and
notes: but he cannot deny himself the pleasure of transcribing the
following passage, so ably corroborative of the opinions advanced above,
as well as in other parts of the preface to his poem.
</p><p class="indd">
“Religion,” says Mr. Godwin, “with them (the patriots) was a serious
consideration, a topic which they were disposed to treat with good
faith, and in earnest. They were sincere patriots to the best of their
judgment, anxious to promote the substantial welfare of their
fellow-creatures. They knew that there can be no real liberty, and no
good political government, without morality; and they believed that the
morality of the various members of the community intimately depended
upon their religious creed, and upon the character and conduct of the
ministers of the national religion.”</p></div>

<p class="indd">In pursuing the train of thought connected with his subject, the author
has been led to touch upon the comparative value of republicanism and
monarchy, as conducive in the spirit of their institutions, to advance
that perfectibility of the social system which he believes it the duty
of every true patriot steadily to pursue. And he could not blink the
question so far, (claiming to give an honest opinion) as to refrain from
avowing that upon the abstract question of theoretical preference he is
decidedly favourable to republicanism; at the same time declaring,
unequivocally and unreservedly, that he will yield to no man in a
cheerful, cordial, and loyal attachment and obedience to the mixed
government under which he lives; identified as it is with the most
generous feelings of his countrymen; and calculated, as in his
conscience he believes it to be, to promote in a superlative<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8a" id="page_8a">[Pg 8]</a></span> degree the
glory and happiness of a people with such habits and dispositions; and
above all with such a condition of moral and intellectual attainment, as
characterizes the community of Englishmen. Nor will he shrink from
avowing, that, individually, he should feel himself necessitated by a
sense of duty, unresistingly (as far as relates to the employment of
physical means,) to obey any form of government, however despotic, under
which he should live, so long as such government had the support and
approbation of the decided majority of his fellow citizens. It might be
his duty to <small>SUFFER</small> in bearing an honourable testimony against tyrants
and tyranny; but at this point, in his individual capacity he must
stop;&mdash;though acting in concert with the true <i>vox-populi</i>, in
resistance to the encroachments of ambitious power, or the exactions of
established despotism, he would not stop at any thing short of its
certain abridgement or final extinction.</p>

<p class="indd">To this spirit in our ancestors we owe the revolutions of 1640 and
1688&mdash;as individuals they suffered long and grievously for the sake of
conscience, and the rights of man in civil society: but individual
suffering became at last so identified with the general feeling of
disgust and indignation at the despotism of the government, that its
character ceased longer to be that of private suffering, or its
remonstrance or resistance the effect of personal consideration: hence a
legitimate opposition to authority on that great principle, that the
public weal forms the only true measure of political allegiance, was
aroused; sanctioning such an appeal to force, as under other
circumstances, would have been justly stigmatized as treason and
rebellion. And it is worthy of remark, that, principally to these two
great events, as regenerating the political constitution of our country,
and unfettering the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9a" id="page_9a">[Pg 9]</a></span>science and intellect of man; are owing, under
providence, most of those stupendous discoveries in science&mdash;and those
sublime achievements of philanthropy, which are rapidly changing in our
day, the moral aspect of the whole world.</p>

<p class="indd">That so much real and permanent good was accomplished by these events,
is a decisive proof that the minds of Englishmen were fitted to receive
and improve the benefits of them; and, of consequence, that a high
degree of criminality attached to the men whose devotion to antiquated
principles of civil government,&mdash;and superstitious veneration for the
high prerogatives of barbarous ages, caused them to close their eyes
against the light of truth, by which they were surrounded, and to lift
their impious, but puny arms against the spirit inspired by heaven for
the moral improvement of its creatures: for whilst there must always
exist in the previous habits and attainments of nations, a qualification
for the rational enjoyment of liberty, in order to prevent it from
becoming a curse rather than a blessing; there ought always to prevail
in governments a disposition to concede so much as the people know how
properly to use;&mdash;if this principle form a constituent in the rule of
any government, it signifies not by what name it is called&mdash;it is
strictly a popular form of government, exercising its powers for the
good of the people: if not, it is essentially despotic&mdash;employing the
resources of the state for its own aggrandizement:&mdash;and will certainly
be overturned at some moment of peculiar excitation, by the natural
efforts made by the people, to render their social condition analogous
to that improved moral and intellectual condition, subsisting at the
period of such excitation&mdash;nor ought it, nor can it be otherwise: nor
needs there any thing more than this simple principle to explain all
popular revo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10a" id="page_10a">[Pg 10]</a></span>lutions, at least, such as have occurred in modern times.
To claim for civil government under any name a right to withstand this
principle, is to insult the moral Governor of the universe, and to libel
human nature by advocating the divine right of governors to rule in
unrighteousness. To enjoy liberty, nations in their individual, as well
as collective capacity, must be wise and virtuous. Independence, it is
true, requires neither the one nor the other of these high attainments;
but <i>independence</i> is only the freedom of the savage state:&mdash;<i>liberty</i>,
the rule of perfect society:&mdash;that happy condition, where man is only
restrained in the exercise of what is injurious to others, or fatal to
himself&mdash;where the laws necessitate no evil, and afford occasion for the
greatest possible good of which the social institution is susceptible.
Independence, mere independence,&mdash;founded on abstract considerations of
the natural powers and propensities of man, irrespective of the moral
effects of established habits and sophisticated institutions, appears to
have been the object contemplated by the leaders in the late French
revolution. Liberty,&mdash;rational liberty!&mdash;built on the firm basis of a
refined morality, deduced from divine Truth and calculated to purify and
exalt human nature, was the good sought for, by most of those men
concerned in the subversion of the throne of the Stuarts. Yet have the
memories of these men been assailed by the senseless cry of “hypocrites
and fanatics,” in every age, by writers who were too timid or too
passionate to take a sober view of their motives and actions: and yet in
reality they were “men of whom the world was not
worthy:”&mdash;philanthropists whose piety and genius broke open the sealed
fountains of truth and happiness, long denied by the despotism of
princes and the artifice of priests, to a suffering world;&mdash;but which
thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11a" id="page_11a">[Pg 11]</a></span> issuing from Britain, have irrigated the world with their
majestic streams, and carried beauty and fertility into regions
apparently doomed for ever, to the sterile dreariness of slavery and
superstition. That they were <i>enthusiasts</i> may be granted: but to
denounce enthusiasm in the cause of religion and liberty, (those great
interests so intimately connected with the real glory and welfare of
mankind,) is to imagine the overthrow of virtue, and to join in
confederacy against the true dignity of human nature. Such conduct in
the bulk of mankind, is as becoming as if the tortoise were to impeach
the character of the noble courser, because in the strength of his
power, he makes the earth to shake beneath him as he scours along the
plain, and overleaps in his might the enclosure which circumscribes
<i>his</i> limited vision.</p>

<p class="indd">It is the cant of despotism and infidelity to decry enthusiasm in the
cause of religion and liberty: they dread its vivifying effects, as they
detest the principles which give birth to its spirit; and therefore seek
to render that contemptible in the eyes of their fellows, which puts to
shame their own pretensions. What, it may be asked, was there in the
degrading frivolity,&mdash;in the cold and cheerless scepticism introduced
among Englishmen, at the restoration of the second Charles, which could
kindle in the breasts of men enthusiasm? or compensate in any degree for
the lofty hopes and generous darings of the Puritan
heroes?&mdash;nothing!&mdash;absolutely nothing!&mdash;all feeling, except malevolence
and voluptuousness, became congealed in the heart of man: and the nation
presented the melancholy spectacle, of a people stricken with a general
blight. It then became the fashion to ridicule the enthusiasm of the
bye-gone days,&mdash;and to brand the reformers and their principles with
terms of oblo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12a" id="page_12a">[Pg 12]</a></span>quy and reproach:&mdash;they were called
“hypocrites,”&mdash;“fanatics,”&mdash;“visionaries,” and “enthusiasts.” That the
leaders of them were sincere, is abundantly proved by their general
character for integrity, and the sacrifices they made to the cause in
which they had engaged;&mdash;that they were not “fanatics” is proved as far,
at least, as respects the <i>Independents</i>, the true Republicans, by the
liberality of their sentiments respecting religious toleration:&mdash;that
they were not altogether visionary in their plans of government, may be
demonstrated from the fact that the broad outline of policy marked out
by them, still continues to be the land-marks of British policy; and has
been so ever since, both with respect to our intercourse with foreign
nations and the conducting of our internal affairs:&mdash;and that their
enthusiasm neither debased their morals, nor weakened the force of their
discrimination nor judgment, the record of their comprehensive plans and
vigorous operations satisfactorily testifies. Among those whose memories
have shared the largest portion of this abuse General Ireton stands
conspicuous. His uncompromising sternness of principle, and intrepidity
of conduct naturally exposed him to this: nor is it to be wondered at
that such a character, possessing so much compass,&mdash;so much originality,
and diversity of feature, should be liable to misrepresentation: it is
the error of weak or rash minds to distort what they cannot comprehend;
and to mistake their own crudities for imperfections in the sublime
objects which they casually contemplate. The only cause for wonder would
have been, if such a character as <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>, had not been exposed to
calumny and misrepresentation, by prejudiced persons, whose feeble or
oblique vision rendered them unable to penetrate the slight mists with
which error or inadvertency occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13a" id="page_13a">[Pg 13]</a></span> dimmed the true light of his
glory: ascribing to deliberate criminality, or designed hypocrisy, what
in reality only arose from the defectibility of human nature. But is it
wise?&mdash;is it generous?&mdash;is it just?&mdash;in Englishmen thus to insult the
memories, and degrade the characters of men to whom they undoubtedly owe
much of that stamina in their moral character, which has so nobly
distinguished them among the nations of the earth? it cannot be! it is
high time that society, in the expression of its language, and the
indulgence of its opinions respecting them, reversed that attainder
under which they were condemned by the frivolous and licentious
generation which followed them. This was, as it were, conventionally
done by the country at the revolution in 1688&mdash;when the Stuarts were
decisively expelled the throne of these realms&mdash;and the foul infection
of their name, allowed no more to pollute the annals of Britain: a most
glorious achievement this; which deliberately recognizing by an act of
legislation the real voice of the people, as the only basis of
legitimate government laid “the divine right of kings” prostrate before
“the majesty of the people;” and then reared in triumph in the portico
of our constitution, as two beautiful pillars, the “Bill of Rights” and
the “Act of Toleration:” thus opening a more noble entrance than had
hitherto been enjoyed into that venerable edifice, reared by the
conjoined efforts of a long succession of more illustrious patriots than
ever graced the annals of any other country; that so Englishmen of every
name and party might be admitted to take refuge in its sanctuary, and
walk exulting in the light of its glory. The revolution of 1688
certainly removed the stigma, which, but for that event might have
rested on the reformers of 1640 as traitors and rebels:&mdash;it gave them
generally a title to our gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14a" id="page_14a">[Pg 14]</a></span> and veneration; and most happy will
the author of this little work feel himself, if, in following so good an
example, he may contribute in any degree, however small, to restore
particularly to his just rank among the acknowledged worthies of
Britain, one of the most illustrious of those patriots, his much abused
countryman, <span class="smcap">Henry Ireton</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16a" id="page_16a">[Pg 16]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15a" id="page_15a">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="indd"><span class="fnote"><a name="FN_1" id="FN_1"></a><a href="#fanc1">(1)</a></span> HENRY IRETON, so well known for his republican principles and the
great part he took in the affairs of his country during the dispute
between Charles the First and his parliament; and, subsequently to the
death of the unfortunate Monarch, for the sway he bore in the councils
of Cromwell, was the eldest Son of German Ireton, Esq. of Attenburrow,
near Nottingham, and was born in the year 1610. He was entered a
Gentleman Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1626; and from his
great proficiency in learning, took, so early as 1629, the degree of
Bachelor of Arts. From College he removed to the Middle Temple, where he
studied the common law; but the civil war breaking out, he quitted his
pursuits in that line, to serve in the army, where he made such
proficiency in the military art, that some have not scrupled to say,
even Cromwell himself learned the rudiments of war from him. He sat in
the long Parliament, for Appleby, but at what time he was returned, does
not appear quite clear; probably some time between 1640 and 1647. Soon
after his going into the army, he married Bridget, eldest daughter of
Mr. Oliver Cromwell, afterwards Protector. At the new modelling of the
army, in 1645, he was raised to the rank of Commissary General, having
rapidly passed through the subordinate degrees of command. He greatly
distinguished himself in many actions, particularly at the battle of
Naseby, in which, his ardor having led him too far from his men, he was
taken prisoner by the Royalists; but, in the confusion which soon after
ensued in the king’s army, he made his escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26b" id="page_26b">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="indd">After the restoration of Charles the Second, the body of <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> was
removed from its tomb, in Westminster Abbey, where it had been interred
with great pomp by direction of Cromwell, and conveyed on a hurdle to
<span class="smcap">Tyburn</span>, upon which it was taken from the coffin and hung on the gibbet
from sun-rise to sun-set; the head was then severed from the body and
set upon a pole, and the carcase buried under the gallows. Ludlow,
speaking of the preceding pompous funeral with which <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> was
honoured, by his father-in-law Cromwell, and in allusion to the
subsequent degradation of his body, says, “<span class="smcap">Ireton</span> would have despised
these pomps, having erected for himself a more glorious monument in the
hearts of good men, by his affection to his country, his abilities of
mind, his impartial justice, his diligence in the public service, and
his virtues; which were a far greater honor to his memory, than a
dormitory among the ashes of kings; who, for the most part, as they had
governed others by their passions, so were they as much governed by
them.”</p>

<div class="poetry1">
<span class="i0"><span class="fnote"><a name="FN_3" id="FN_3"></a><a href="#fanc3">(3)</a></span> “<i>By which thou laid’st the treach’rous Stuart low</i>:”<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="indd">Noble says, “<span class="smcap">Ireton</span> was perhaps more than any other man the cause of the
king’s death:&mdash;and which is said to be owing to his having intercepted a
letter from his Majesty to the Queen, in which his destruction along
with that of Cromwell was fixed:” thus attempting to make private
revenge or retaliation, rather than a sense of public duty, the
operating principle of his mind in his subsequent conduct towards the
infatuated monarch. A notion in which he is not at all borne out by
contemporary testimony: for though Bishop Burnet remarks, that “Cromwell
was wavering whether to put the king to death or not; but that <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>,
who had the temper and principles of a <span class="smcap">Cassius</span>, stuck at nothing that
might have turned England into a Commonwealth, hoping that by the king’s
death that all men concerned in it would become irreconcileable to
monarchy;” yet it cannot be reasonably inferred from this, that he was
at all actuated by personal considerations, but only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27b" id="page_27b">[Pg 27]</a></span> that by this
decisive step, when Charles’s insincerity was placed beyond doubt, such
a bond of union would be formed amongst the whole body of Reformers, and
their immediate descendants, as should, in a manner, guarantee the
complete abolition of royalty, by a sense of the common danger to which
they would be exposed, in their persons and properties, by its
restoration.</p>

<p class="indd">Mrs. Hutchinson, in her memoirs, alluding to the condition and treatment
of the king at Hampton Court, after he was delivered up to the
Parliamentary Commissioners by the Scots, says, “The king, by reason of
his daily converse with the officers, began to be trinkling with them,
and had drawn in some of them to engage others to fall in with him;” but
to speak the truth of all, Cromwell was at that time so uncorruptibly
faithful to his trust, and to the people’s interest, that he could not
be drawn in to practice even his own usual and natural dissimulations on
that occasion. His son-in-law, <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>, that was as faithful as he, was
not so fully of opinion (till he had tried it and found to the contrary)
but that the king might have been managed to comply with the public good
of his people, after he could no longer uphold his own violent will;
but, upon some discourses with him, the king uttering these words to
him, “I shall <i>play my game</i> as well as I can,” <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> replied, “if your
Majesty have <i>a game</i> to play, you must give us liberty also to play
ours.”</p>

<p class="indd">Colonel Hutchinson discoursing privately with his cousin (<span class="smcap">Ireton</span>) about
the conversations he had with the king,&mdash;the latter made use of these
expressions: “He gave us words, and we paid him in his own coin, <i>when
we found he had no real intention to the people’s good</i>, but to prevail
by our factions, to regain by art what he had lost in fight.”</p>

<p class="indd">This conviction of the king’s insincerity, and this alone, appears to
have determined <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> to accomplish his death. The public good he
evidently believed required it: and, as in this cause, he was prepared
to lay down his own life; so he was resolved that no individual’s life
should be an obstacle to its furtherance. That “he was perhaps more than
any other man the cause of the king’s death,” may be readily believed:
but that his conduct in that solemn affair proceeded upon the despicable
principle of private revenge, because the king had secretly resolved,
previously, upon his destruction and that of Cromwell, may be safely
denied. His motives are better explained in the following extract from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28b" id="page_28b">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the speech made by him upon the motion that no more addresses be made to
the King, from Parliament, nor any messages received from him; wherein
he says, “Subjection to the king is but in lieu of protection from him,
which being denied, we may settle the kingdom without him.” With his
rooted antipathy to the government of a single person, and his bold and
decisive character; at the same time possessing a mind fitted for the
most daring resolves, and capacious of enterprizes requiring boldness,
and skill in their accomplishment, there can be no wonder that he was
amongst the foremost in bringing about the death of the king. This
perfectly agrees with the character given of him by <span class="smcap">Neal</span>, in his history
of the Puritans, where he remarks, “Lieutenant-General Ireton was bred
to the law, and was a person of great integrity; bold and intrepid in
all his enterprizes, and never to be diverted from what he thought just
and right, by any arguments or considerations. He was most liberal in
employing his purse and hazarding his person in the service of the
Public.” To this may be added the testimony of <span class="smcap">Whitlock</span>, who, in
speaking of some reforms proposed in the election and composition of the
House of Commons, says, “<span class="smcap">Ireton</span> was chiefly employed in them, having
learned some grounds of law, and having a laborious and working brain
and fancy.” In another place he remarks, “this gentleman (Ireton) was a
person very active, industrious, and stiff in his ways and purposes: he
was of good abilities for council as well as action; made much use of
his pen, and was very forward to reform the proceedings in law, wherein
his having been bred a lawyer was a great help to him. He was stout in
the field, and wary in councils; exceedingly forward as to the business
of a Commonwealth.” These credentials of character and motive, will,
undoubtedly, prove sufficient to every impartial mind, to clear the fame
of General Ireton from the foul stigma attempted to be fixed on it by
<span class="smcap">Noble</span>, in his memoirs.</p>

<div class="poetry1">
<span class="i0"><span class="fnote"><a name="FN_4" id="FN_4"></a><a href="#fanc4">(4)</a></span> “<i>to thy exalted mind</i>”<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="indd"><span class="smcap">Ireton</span> was, in his day, emphatically called the “Scribe,” from his skill
in drawing up petitions, declarations, &amp;c. The remonstrance of the army
for justice against the king, the agreement of the people, the ordinance
for the trial of the king, the precept for proclaiming the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29b" id="page_29b">[Pg 29]</a></span> court
of justice, and many other important state papers of that eventful
period, are believed to be his production.</p>

<p class="indd">Extracts from one or two of these interesting documents will tend to
place the character and principles of this virtuous republican in their
just light, and strikingly exemplify the fact that there is scarcely a
great object of reform at present contemplated by British patriots, or
which has been entertained at any period since his time, but what his
bold and sagacious mind had entertained as necessary to secure the
liberty of the subject. The proposals of the army, as preserved in
Rushworth, contemplate the following great objects of political reform,
viz. “that the duration of parliaments be limited,&mdash;elections better
regulated,&mdash;the representation more equally distributed,&mdash;improper
privileges of members of parliament given up,&mdash;the coercive powers and
civil penalties of bishops taken away,&mdash;the laws simplified and lessened
in expense,&mdash;monopolies set aside,&mdash;tythes commuted,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indd">In “the agreement of the people,” designed to change the form of
government into a simple commonwealth without a king or house of lords,
were the following just and liberal sentiments relating to religion: and
which, through the bigotry of the age, were the main cause of its not
being more generally supported, viz. “All persons professing religion,
however differing in judgment from the doctrine, discipline, and worship
publicly held forth, to be protected in the profession of their faith,
and exercise of their religion according to their consciences, so as
they abuse not this liberty to the civil injury of others, or the
disturbance of the public peace.” Yet is this great man continually
branded as a fanatical sectarian, by the advocates of arbitrary power,
although his patriotism, his benevolence and candour, are apparent in
all the public transactions of the eventful period in which he lived,
over which he had any control, or with which he was in any way
concerned.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>No more was heard, which once controll’d his choice.</i>”<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="indd">The great influence which <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> possessed over <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>, and the
obstacles which his unbending republican principles, and genuine
patriotism presented to the accomplishment of his ambitious longings,
are strikingly remarked by Mrs Hutchinson, who says, “His (Cromwell’s)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30b" id="page_30b">[Pg 30]</a></span>
son-in-law, <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>, lord deputy of Ireland, would not be wrought over to
serve him, but hearing of his machinations, determined to endeavour to
divert him from such destructive courses. But God cut him short by
death.” And it is delicately remarked by the editor of that lady’s
memoirs, in a note, by way of comment, on an act of Cromwell towards
Col. Hutchinson, that, “it may be thought there wanted but little,
perhaps only the survivance of <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>, to have made Cromwell
<i>intrinsically</i>, as well as <i>splendidly</i> Great.” A finer compliment to
the genius and virtues of <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> cannot well be imagined.</p>

<p class="indd"><span class="smcap">Whitlock</span> says, “Cromwell had a great opinion of him, and no man could
prevail so much, or order him so far, as <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> could;” his death is
very pointedly regretted by the same author, on account of the great
influence he had over the mind of Cromwell; deeming it more than
probable, that the prolongation of his life might have made a great
difference in the subsequent conduct of that extraordinary man: the
justness of which supposition is strikingly exemplified, by the change
in Cromwell’s policy, which almost immediately followed upon this event.</p>

<p class="indd">“General Ireton,” says the history of England, “was much celebrated for
his vigilance, industry, capacity, and for the strict execution of
justice in that unlimited command which he possessed in Ireland. He was
observed to be inflexible in all his purposes for the public good; and
was animated with so sincere and passionate love of liberty, that he
never could have been induced by any motive, to submit to the smallest
appearance of regal government. Cromwell was much affected by his death;
and the republicans who reposed unlimited confidence in him were
disconsolate.”</p>

highest degree; they admired him alike as a soldier and a statesman, and
revered him as a saint.”</p>

<p class="indd">The man who was acknowledged to have such claims, by the commonwealth’s
men, a body comprizing, probably, more genius, virtue, and sterling
patriotism, than were ever united for the accomplishment of any social
purpose in the annals of mankind, must have been unquestionably an
extraordinary person; and is, it may safely be affirmed, still entitled
to the high veneration of every real friend to the true interests of
man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31b" id="page_31b">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="indd">Previous to the standard of resistance to the arbitrary proceedings of
the court being raised in England, several small bodies of puritans had
passed over to America, and began the colonization of the tract of land
called <i>New England</i>: many more joined them upon the approach of the
troubles which they saw coming upon the country; impelled, partly, by a
desire to avoid being engaged in open rebellion against the government,
whose violence and tyranny they perceived were driving men’s minds to
desperate resolves, but mostly influenced by an earnest fervor to enjoy
amidst the solitudes of that unexplored country, the privilege of
worshipping God agreeably with the dictates of an enlightened
conscience: a privilege they could not enjoy in their native country,
under the bigoted and intolerant policy which swayed in the councils of
the misguided Charles: this consideration had, at one time, induced
<i>Cromwell</i>, <i>Hampden</i>, <i>Haslerigge</i>, and many other non-conformists of
rank and influence, to determine to take refuge in New England: Cromwell
and his family, as well as others of the party, had embarked, and the
rest were on the point of so doing, but were prevented leaving the
kingdom by an order in council, “directing the lord treasurer to take
speedy and effectual course for the stay of eight ships then in the
river Thames, prepared to go to New England, and for putting on land all
the passengers and provisions therein intended for the voyage.” “Those
whom God destines to destruction, he deprives of their
understanding,”&mdash;the very men thus compelled by the king in council to
remain at home, became the immediate instruments by which the blood of
the saints, and the cries of the oppressed were avenged on a guilty
court and a cruel hierarchy. When the restoration of the Stuarts to
power became apparent, still greater numbers of the republicans and
non-conformists sought refuge in New England from the persecutions which
they foresaw awaited them. To the descendants of these men, inheriting
the noble detestation of arbitrary power which so strikingly
distinguished their forefathers, America owes all her <i>real</i> greatness.
The New England men still exhibit a distinct feature in American
society, and probably possess more virtue, intelligence, and
independence of character than is to be found in any other state in the
union.&mdash;<i>See Doctor Dwight’s Travels in New England.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32b" id="page_32b">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="indd">For the disinterestedness of <span class="smcap">Ireton’s</span> motives in the discharge of his
public functions, the following anecdote from <span class="smcap">Ludlow</span>, who was next in
command to him in Ireland, at the period of the transaction, shall
suffice.</p>

<p class="indd">“The parliament,” he says, “also ordered an act to be brought in, for
settling two thousand pounds per annum on the lord-deputy <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>,” (out
of the confiscated estates of the Duke of Buckingham, and which,
therefore, it might have been thought he could have the more
conscientiously accepted than, though it had been drawn directly from
the pockets of the people,) the news of which, being brought over, was
so unacceptable to him, that he said, they had many just debts, which he
desired they would pay before they made such presents; that he had no
need of their lands, <i>and would not have it</i>; and that <i>he should be
more contented to see them doing the service of the nation, than so
liberal in disposing of the public treasure!</i>&mdash;What would the patriotic
general have said of some modern British parliaments?&mdash;No wonder, that
the hungry place and pension hunting pack, that returned in the train of
Charles the second, procured the exhumation of the bones of such an
enemy to their tribe as <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>: the light of whose glory, in his
generosity and disinterestedness, showed so much of the deformity of
their mercenary and malignant natures&mdash;that indignity towards all that
remained of him, in their power, as far as their little malice could
accomplish it, was necessary to give them any degree of consequence,
even in their own eyes.</p>
